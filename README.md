# Messy Code

## ex1

We need to simulate the middle ages. There are two types of people: peasants and nobles. We should track whether a person is hungry. We need to be able to look up people by their names. When there is a feast, we should feed the nobles first, by feeding all of the nobles who are hungry in order. Then if there is food left, feed the peasants in the order they were added.


## ex2

We need to simulate Knights who battle each other. A Knight has a name, strength, and health. When two knights battle, the take turns attacking each other. An attack reduces the health of the other knight by a random value between 1 and the attacker's strength. Knights keep battling until their health goes to 0 or below, in which case they are defeated.

## ex3

We need to track Ninjas and their guilds. A Ninja has a name, and an amount of honor. Guilds have a name and can have any number of Ninjas. We should be able to add a Ninja to a guild. We should be able to list all the Ninjas in the order they were added.

## ex4

We need to track Ninjas who will battle each other. A Ninja has a name, strength, and health. When two Ninjas battle, they take turns attacking each other, and we randomly select who attacks first each round. An attack reduces the health of the other Ninja by a random value between 1 and the attacker's strength. Ninjas keep battling until one of their health goes to 0 or below, in which case they are defeated. 

## ex5

Swifties want tickets to Taylor Swift's latest concern from TicketMaster. They line up and then TicketMaster will serve them tickets first in first out. TicketMaster can decide how many tickets are available for a concert. The first N people in line (assuming TicketMaster has N tickets) will get a ticket, and the rest will not receive a ticket.

## In person critiques of code they've never really seen before

* everything in main
* everything static
* everything String
* everything array
* use ArrayList as a Queue
* public variables that are accessed directly
* priority queue where everything has the same priority
* use String instead of Person or something like that
* just use sort() method; don't sort it yourself
* API methods that print
* exception handling
*
